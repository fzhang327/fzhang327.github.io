I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the **University of Houston**, specializing in **safe, robust control, autonomous systems, and robotics**. My research focuses on bridging **control theory with machine learning** for UAVs, manipulators, and autonomous vehicles

My research interests include:
* **Control Systems:** Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC), Control Barrier Functions (CBF), Extended State Observer (ESO), Model Predictive Control (MPC).
* **Robotics Platforms:** PX4 UAVs, F1Tenth racing cars, Quadruped robots (HOPPY), and Manipulators.
